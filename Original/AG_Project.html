		<h3>A Soil Mystery</h3> <br>
		<p id="starting-paragraph">
			This is a choose your story adventure. It has many soil elements,
			as it was made as a project for AG class. This is a premade character,
			so you'll have to remember that. If that doesn't sound interesting to you,
			feel free to leave. But if it does, get ready, and let's start.
		</p>
		<p id="visible"> 
			You wake up to a dark room, slowly remembering your life like you do each day.
			Remember why you exist and all that. For example, you go by they/them.
			<br>
			And you work at an agency with your roommate. Right. So, why did you wake up?
			Well, said roommate is using really loud unintelligible whispers.
			You can make out their whispering, you can’t tell what about. What do you do?
		</p>
		<input type="button" id="button1" value="Ask your roommate."
		onClick="visible() + invisible() + start() + button3a() + button4a() + button1() + button2()">

		onCLick="invisible() + start() + visible2() + button1() + button2() + button20()">
        
		<p id="invisible">
			The whispers stop. Your roommate looks over to you. “Don’t worry about it. Go back to bed.” They aren’t gonna tell you                   anything. Maybe you should investigate.
        	Back at the office, you notice some of your coworkers and your roommate talking about the case. You could eavesdrop, but if               anyone notices you’ll have a lot of explaining to do.

			You roll off the bed and break your fall so it was quiet.
	       	So, it may have hurt some, but nobody noticed.
	       	You slowly move to the wall between the bedroom and the living room.
	       	The whispers are now comprehendible. 
	       	“No I’m pretty sure they're asleep. Yeah, okay I’ll join the case.
	       	Okay, room 231. Got it. See you tomorrow.” The roommate hangs up.
	       	What are they hiding? Well, don’t worry about it now!
	       	They want to go back to bed and they share a room with you. <br>
            The next day, you practically rush out the door, pushing your
            roommate against the main doorframe of your apartment.
            You get in your car and get to work.
            You see you’re one of the first people in the office,
            and after signing in to head straight to room 231 and find a large cabinet to hide in.
            For about 35 minutes you sit and wait. -Your boss is gonna be so mad-.
            Suddenly you hear rustling and people chatting as they enter the room,
            you silent down, and turn off your phone. <br>
            "Okay, Hannah Roman?” Chief Joan exclaims. <br>
            “Here.” Says the receptionist that always offers you tea bags. Not tea. Teabags. <br>
            “Charles Stork?” Ah, your roommate, whom is a liar. <br>
            “Matt Rodgers?” Matt? What? Did they choose HIM, over you? How outrageous. <br>
            “Clark Bunner?” Clark? Isn’t he an intern in business management? <br>
            “Good. So everybody is here? Then we shall continue. Everybody take a file. <br>
            Jackal Smith was a woman who was found in South Grate Park. <br>
            She was found with worms digging through her skin and 9 stab wounds.” <br>
            Worms? What type? <br> “What type of worms?” Charles asks, ah, <br>
            he can get the first pick of the next movie night. <br>
            “Pinworms.” The chief responds <br>
          	“That’s peculiar.” and he’s absolutely right. Since pinworms prefer loamy-textured soils, not sandy clay areas. <br>
	        “Alright, we have a train to catch in 4 hours. I expect everybody to be there." <br>

            You duck behind one of the desks in the office space and strain your ears to listen to their conversation over the constant               babble of the office. <br>
            “So, where do we want to go first?” asked Matt Rodgers. They just had to choose him. <br>
            “I found the appearance of pinworms pretty unusual.” said your roommate, Charles Stork. <br>
            Wait, pinworms in this area? Where was the body? <br>
            “We should probably start at the area it was found,” said Clark Bunner. <br>
            At least someone has a shred of sense around here. <br>
            “Actually, we have a train to catch. 4 hours remember?” said Hannah Roman as they already started to walk away. <br>
            I guess we have a train ride now. Might as well continue investigating in the meantime. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p id="go-away">
            You pull aside one of the idle workers to feign conversation. <br>
            “What the-” They said in surprise. <br>
            “Quiet. I need to figure out what’s going on.” <br>
            You listen for the conversation next to you over the babble of the workplace. <br>
            “So, where do we want to go first?” asked Matt Rodgers. They just had to choose him. <br>
            “I found the appearance of pinworms pretty unusual.” said your roommate, Charles Stork. <br>
            Finally escaping the shock of being suddenly pulled to the side, the person has a chance to speak. <br>
            “What’s this all about? What’s so important that they wouldn’t tell you?” <br>
            “I already tried asking, now be quiet, this is important!” <br>
            Over the talking of the worker, you couldn’t make out the rest of the conversation, aside from Clark Bunner and Hannah Roman             walking away. <br>
            “Now look at what you’ve done.” You say impatiently. <br>
            “I can try to help.” <br>
            “You’ve done quite enough actually.” <br>
            I guess you’ll need to do some more investigating. <br>
        </p>

            You enter the library and plop down with a book about soil. It says, “Mineral matter is non-living substances that come from             weathered rock to form soil. Air and water occupy pore spaces between soil particles. Organic matter is the accumulation of               decayed or partially decayed plants and animals, roots, and living organisms.
            Sand is the largest size particle, Silt is the mid-sized soil particle. Clay is the smallest sized particle.” Well that’s                 helpful.
        </p>
        <p id="invisible2b">
            You carefully approach Charles with a trained look on your face, he’s currently sitting at his desk looking over a file. You             assume the one you need.
        	“Charles! Hey! What’s going on?” Charles quickly closed the file he was reading. <br>
        	“Oh, hey, Fred!” That’s not your name, but you’re used to it. “Nothing much… why?” <br>
        	“Because I was curious, why else? Oooh, got something you want to tell me?” You edge. <br>
        	“What do you know?” Charles said darkly, you pull a cheeky look. <br>
        	“Betty said you had a date with Jess?” <br>
        	“She said, what?” <br>
        	“That you had a date with Jess!” Charles looked conflicted. <br>
        	“I’ll be right back.” Charles sighed heading to Betty. <br>
        	You steal the victim’s file from Charles’s desk. <br>
        </p>
        <p id="invisible3b">
            You sit in the storage room, looking through tools they’re weirdly scattered everywhere, making your job extremely difficult.
        </p>
        <p id="invisible4b">
            You arrive at the train station, seeing your co-workers getting in on one side, luckily you picked up a disguise. You put on             a hat and sunglasses and go inside, you sit next to the group, and wait for the train to move… <br>
            <br>
            Well, sorry folks! We don’t have any more for ya’ll right now! I know, disappointing. This game is still in beta testing. It             may be continued to be worked on, but we’re not sure. Have a great life, don’t eat pinworms.
