				You roll of your bed and break your <br>
				fall so it was quiet. Okay, so it <br>
				may have hurt some, but nobody <br>
				noticed. You slowly move to the wall <br>
				between the bedroom and the living <br>
				room. The whispers are now <br>
				comprehendable. <br>
				<br>
				"No, I'm pretty sure they're asleep. <br>
				Yeah, I'll join the case. Room 231, <br>
				got it. See you tomorrow." <br>
				<br>
				Your roommate hangs up. What are they <br>
				hiding? Well, don't worry about it <br>
				now. They want to go back to bed, <br>
				and they share a room with you! <br>
