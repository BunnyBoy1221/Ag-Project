				The next day, you practically rush <br>
				out the door, pushing your roommate <br>
				against the main doorframe of your <br>
				apartment. You get in your car and <br>
				go to work. You see you're one on the <br>
				first people in the office, and after <br>
				signing in you head straight to room <br>
				231 and find a large cabinet to hide <br>
				in. For about 35 minutes you sit and <br>
				wait. -Your boss is going to be so mad- <br>
				<br>
				Suddenly you hear rustling and people <br>
				chatting as they enter the room. You <br>
				quiet down and silence your phone. <br>
				<br>
				"Okay, Hannah Roman?" Chief joan Exclaims. <br>
				"Here," says the receptionist who always offers <br>
				you tea bags. Not tea, tea bags. <br>
				"Charles Stork?" Ah, your roommate, <br>
				whom is a liar. <br>
				"Matt Rodgers?" Matt? What? They chose <br>
				HIM over you? How outrageous.
				"Clark Bunner?" Clark? Isn't he the intern <br>
				in business managment? <br>
				"Good, so everybody is here? Then we shall <br>
				continue. Everybody take a file". <br>
				<br>
				"Jackal Smith was a woman who was found in South Grate Park. <br>
				She was found with worms digging through her skin, and <br>
				nine stab wounds." <br>
				Worms? What type? <br>
				"What type of worms?" asked Charles. Ah, they can get the next <br>
				pick for movie night. <br>
				"Pinworms." answered the chief. <br>
				"That's peculier." And he's absolutly right. <br>
				Since pinworms prefer loamy textured soils. Not <br>
				sandy clay ones. <br>
				"Alright. We have a train to catch in 4 hours. <br>
				I expect everybody to be there." <br>
