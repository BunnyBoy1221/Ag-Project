            <p>
				You enter the library and plop down with a book about soil. <br>
				It says, “Mineral matter is non-living substances that come from <br>
				weathered rock to form soil. Air and water occupy pore spaces <br>
				between soil particles. Organic matter is the accumulation of <br>
				decayed or partially decayed plants and animals, roots, and living organisms. <br>
				Sand is the largest size particle, Silt is the mid-sized soil particle. <br>
				Clay is the smallest sized particle.” Well that’s helpful.
