				You duck behind one of the desks in <br>
				the office and strain your ears to <br>
				listen to their conversation. <br>
				<br>
				"So, where to we want to go first?" <br>
				asked Matt Rodgers. They just had to choose him. <br>
				"I found the appearance of Pinworms pretty unusual," <br>
				said your roommate, Charles Stork. <br>
				Wait, pinworms, in this area? Where was the body? <br>
				We should probably start at the area it was found, <br>
				said Clark Bunner. At least someone has a shred of <br>
				sense around here. <br>
				"Actually, we have a train to catch. 4 hours, remember?" <br>
				Said Hannah Roman, as they already started to walk away. <br>
				I guess you have a train ride now. Might as well keep investigating. <br>
