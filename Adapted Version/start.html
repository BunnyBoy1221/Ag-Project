                You wake up to a dark room, slowly
                remembering your life like you do
                each day. Remember why you exist
                and all that. For example, you go
                by they/them.
                <br>
                And you work at an agency with your
                roommate. Right. So, why did you wake
                up? Well, said roommate is using really
                loud unintelligible whispers. You can
                tell they're whispering, but you can't
                tell what about. What do you do?
