            <p>
				You pull aside one of the idle workers to feign conversation. <br>
				"What the-" they say in surprise. <br>
				"Quiet. I need to figure out what's going on." <br>
				You listen for the conversation next to your over the <br>
				babble of the workplace. <br>
				“So, where do we want to go first?” asked Matt Rodgers. <br>
				They just had to choose him. <br>
				“I found the appearance of pinworms pretty unusual.” <br>
				said your roommate, Charles Stork. <br>
				Finally escaping the shock of being suddenly pulled to the side, <br>
				the person has a chance to speak. <br>
				“What’s this all about? What’s so important that they wouldn’t tell you?” <br>
				“I already tried asking, now be quiet, this is important!” <br>
				Over the talking of the worker, you couldn’t make out the <br>
				rest of the conversation, aside from Clark Bunner and Hannah Roman walking away. <br>
				“Now look at what you’ve done.” You say impatiently. <br>
				“I can try to help.” <br>
				“You’ve done quite enough actually.” <br>
				I guess you’ll need to do some more investigating. <br>
