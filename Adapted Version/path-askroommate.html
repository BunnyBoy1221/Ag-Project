				The whispers stop. Your roommate looks over to you.
				"Don't worry about it. Go back to bed."
				They aren't going to tell you anything.
				Maybe you should investigate.

				Back at the office, you notice some of your coworkers
				and your roommate talking about the case. You could
				eavesdrop, but if anyone notices, you'll have a lot
				of explaining to do.
