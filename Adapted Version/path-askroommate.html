				The whispers stop. Your roommate looks over to you. <br>
				"Don't worry about it. Go back to bed." <br>
				They aren't going to tell you anything. <br>
				Maybe you should investigate. <br>
				<br>
				Back at the office, you notice some of your coworkers <br>
				and your roommate talking about the case. You could <br>
				eavesdrop, but if anyone notices, you'll have a lot <br>
				of explaining to do. <br>
