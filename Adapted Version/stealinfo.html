				You carefully approach Charles with a trained <br>
				look on your face, he’s currently sitting at his <br>
				desk looking over a file. You assume the one you need. <br>
				“Charles! Hey! What’s going on?” Charles quickly <br>
				closed the file he was reading. <br>
				“Oh, hey, Fred!” That’s not your name, but you’re used to it. <br>
				“Nothing much… why?” <br>
				“Because I was curious, why else? Oooh, got something you want to tell me?” <br>
				You edge. <br>
				“What do you know?” Charles said darkly, you pull a cheeky look. <br>
				“Betty said you had a date with Jess?” <br>
				“She said, what?” <br>
				“That you had a date with Jess!” Charles looked conflicted. <br>
				“I’ll be right back.” Charles sighed heading to Betty. <br>
				You steal the victim’s file from Charles’s desk. <br>
