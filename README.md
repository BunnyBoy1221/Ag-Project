# Ag-Project

This was originally built in Agriculture for a project, that I've adapted to be a GitHub entry.
we were told to make our own game, most likely expecting a boardgame,
but this was what we ended up with. My friend wrote the story,
I wrote the code. This is the small demo bit we finished in class, but we may be adding more in the future.

I've included both the original version, and the one I've adapted.
If you're wondering why the original is so complicated, I was
trying to fit the entire thing into one file, which was
difficult, but eventually worked. Just click on the file in original,
or click on intro in the adapted.

Have fun, and good job actually paying attention to the readme.
